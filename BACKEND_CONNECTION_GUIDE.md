# Backend Connection Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ Backend Status: CONNECTED

Your backend is successfully connected and working on **http://localhost:8080**

## üîç How to Check Backend Connection

### Method 1: Run the Test Script (Easiest)

```bash
npx tsx src/test-backend-connection.ts
```

This will show you:
- ‚úÖ If the backend is connected
- üìä How many job roles were fetched
- üìÑ Details of a specific job role

**Expected output when connected:**
```
‚úÖ SUCCESS! Backend is connected.
üìä Found 12 job role(s):
  - ID: 1, Role: Senior Software Engineer
  - ID: 2, Role: Frontend Developer
  ...
```

**Expected output when NOT connected:**
```
‚ùå FAILED! Backend is not connected or not responding.
   Make sure your backend is running on http://localhost:8080
```

---

### Method 2: Use curl (Command Line)

Test the job roles endpoint:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/job-roles
```

Test a specific job role:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/job-roles/1
```

**Expected:** You should see JSON data with job roles

---

### Method 3: Use Your Browser

Open these URLs in your browser:
- http://localhost:8080/api/job-roles (all job roles)
- http://localhost:8080/api/job-roles/1 (specific job role)

**Expected:** You should see JSON data displayed

---

### Method 4: Check from VS Code Terminal

```bash
# Quick connection test
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/job-roles | head -c 100

# Check if backend is responding
curl -I http://localhost:8080/api/job-roles
```

## üìã Backend Data Format

The backend returns data in this format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "jobRoleName": "Senior Software Engineer",
      "location": "Belfast, Northern Ireland",
      "capability": "Engineering",
      "band": "Senior",
      "closingDate": "2026-02-10T18:30:23.000Z",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

The `AxiosJobRoleService` automatically maps this to your frontend format:
- `id` ‚Üí `jobRoleId`
- `jobRoleName` ‚Üí `roleName`
- Extracts data from `response.data.data`

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Backend Not Connected?

1. **Check if backend is running:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/api/job-roles
   ```

2. **If you get "Connection refused":**
   - Make sure your backend server is started
   - Check that it's running on port 8080
   - Verify no firewall is blocking the connection

3. **If backend is on a different port/URL:**
   Update the service constructor:
   ```typescript
   const service = new AxiosJobRoleService('http://localhost:YOUR_PORT');
   ```

4. **Check backend logs:**
   Look at your backend terminal for any errors
