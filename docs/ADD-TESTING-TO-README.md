# Adding Test Reports to Your README

This document shows how to update your main README.md to document the test reporting system.

## Sections to Add/Update

### In the 🛠️ Available Scripts Section

Add these entries:

```markdown
#### Testing & Reports
- `npm run test` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:run` - Run all tests once and generate report
- `npm run test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage and generate report
- `npm run test:watch` - Watch mode for tests
- `npm run test:ui` - Interactive test UI
- `npm run test:e2e` - Run end-to-end tests with Playwright and generate report
- `npm run test:e2e:ui` - Interactive E2E test UI
- `npm run test:e2e:headed` - Run E2E tests in headed mode (see browser)
- `npm run test:e2e:debug` - Debug E2E tests
- `npm run test:e2e:report` - View latest Playwright HTML report
- `npm run test:e2e:chrome` - Run E2E tests in Chrome only
- `npm run report:generate` - Manually generate test report
- `npm run report:view` - View latest test report in terminal
- `npm run report:init` - Initialize test reporting system
```

### In the 🏗️ Development Section

Add a Testing subsection:

```markdown
#### Testing Your Changes

The project includes comprehensive unit and E2E testing with automatic report generation.

##### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests (watch mode)
npm run test

# Unit tests (one-time run with report)
npm run test:run

# Unit tests with coverage metrics
npm run test:coverage

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# View latest test report
npm run report:view
```

##### Test Reports

After running tests with `npm run test:run`, `npm run test:coverage`, or `npm run test:e2e`, a detailed test report is automatically generated in the `reports/` directory.

Reports include:
- Overall test status (pass/fail)
- Test count and pass rate
- Code coverage metrics (lines, branches, functions, statements)
- Failed test details with error messages
- Test execution time

View the latest report:
```bash
npm run report:view
```

**Note**: Reports are saved in `reports/test-report-latest.txt` and `reports/test-report-latest.json`

##### Coverage Requirements

- **New Code**: Minimum 80% coverage
- **Controllers**: 100% branch coverage
- **Services**: 100% branch coverage for critical paths
- **Overall**: Maintain or improve existing coverage

For full testing documentation, see [Testing Quick Start Guide](./TESTING-QUICK-START.md)
```

### In the 📝 Configuration Section

Add test configuration info:

```markdown
#### Test Configuration

- **Unit Tests**: Configured in `vitest.config.ts`
  - Provider: V8
  - Environment: Node.js
  - Coverage reporters: Text, JSON, HTML
  
- **E2E Tests**: Configured in `playwright.config.ts`
  - Browsers: Chromium (Desktop Chrome)
  - Screenshots on failure
  - Video recording on failure
  - Automatic server startup

- **Test Reports**: Generated by `scripts/generate-test-report.ts`
  - Formats: Text (readable) and JSON (machine-readable)
  - Location: `reports/` directory
  - Auto-generated after test runs
```

## Sample README Update

Here's a complete example of what to add to your main README:

```markdown
## 🧪 Testing

This project includes comprehensive testing with automatic report generation.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run unit tests and generate report
npm run test:run

# View the report
npm run report:view

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# View coverage report
open coverage/index.html
```

### Test Coverage

All new code must have at least 80% test coverage. Critical paths (controllers, services) require 100% branch coverage.

### Running Tests

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `npm run test` | Watch mode for unit tests |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Unit tests with coverage metrics |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Run E2E tests with Playwright |
| `npm run test:e2e:headed` | E2E tests with visible browser |
| `npm run report:view` | Display latest test report |

### Test Reports

Detailed test reports are automatically generated after running tests. Reports include:

- Overall status and pass rate
- Code coverage breakdown
- Failed test details
- Execution time and performance metrics

Latest report location: `reports/test-report-latest.txt`

For complete testing documentation, see [Testing Quick Start](./TESTING-QUICK-START.md).
```

## Full Example Integration

Here's how this might look in context of a complete README:

```markdown
# Team2 Job App Frontend

Modern Node.js TypeScript Express server application with comprehensive testing.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run test:run  # Run tests and generate report
npm run report:view
```

## 🛠️ Available Scripts

### Development
- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Run production build

### Testing & Reports ← NEW SECTION
- `npm run test:run` - Run all tests and generate report
- `npm run test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage and generate report
